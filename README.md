# Velociraptor Syslog Monitor

A Python-based monitoring system that monitors Velociraptor audit logs via Velociraptor syslog feaure and sends email notifications about important user actions.

## Overview

This tool monitors Velociraptor's syslog messages for specific actions performed by users within the Velociraptor DFIR platform. When certain patterns are detected, it sends detailed email notifications to designated recipients, providing enhanced visibility into user activities and potential security events.

## Features

- **Real-time monitoring**: Listens for Velociraptor audit logs via UDP syslog (default port 514)
- **Comprehensive activity detection**: Monitors numerous critical user actions including:
  - PowerShell and CMD command execution
  - Host quarantine/isolation actions
  - Host quarantine/isolation removal
  - Hunt creation, execution, cancellation, and deletion
  - Client label management
  - VFS Directory traversal
  - Recursive VFS directory operations
  - Recursive VFS file downloads
  - VFS Registry access (Traversals & download opperations)
  - Artifact management (creation and deletion)
  - User account management
  - Organization creation
  - Password resets
  - And more...
- **Detailed email notifications**: Sends formatted notifications with relevant context for each detected event
- **Flexible configuration**: Command-line options for customizing behavior
- **Multi-threading**: Separate threads for log collection and processing
- **Comprehensive logging**: Debug and info level logs for troubleshooting

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Active Velociraptor server installation
- **Velociraptor syslog configuration**: The Velociraptor server must have syslog configured to forward `VelociraptorAudit` messages to the host where this script runs
- SMTP server for sending email notifications

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DrPwner/Velociraptor-Syslog.git
cd Velociraptor-Syslog
```

2. Install any required Python dependencies (standard library only)

## Velociraptor Configuration

In your Velociraptor `server.config.yaml` file, ensure that syslog is properly configured:

```yaml
Logging:
  # ... other logging configurations ...
  output_directory: /opt/velociraptor/logs
  separate_logs_per_component: true
  remote_syslog_server: 192.168.1.10:514
  remote_syslog_protocol: "udp"
  remote_syslog_components:
  - VelociraptorAudit
```
https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor/blob/master/docs/references/server.config.yaml#L984

**Important:** Only forward `VelociraptorAudit` syslog messages to this service. The script is designed to parse and process these specific messages.

## Usage

Run the script with the required parameters:

```bash
python velociraptor-syslog.py \
  --smtp-server smtp.example.com \
  --smtp-port 587 \
  --sender-email alerts@example.com \
  --recipient-email security-team@example.com \
  --cc ThatUser@c-o.com 
```

### Command Line Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--host` | Host IP to listen on | `0.0.0.0` |
| `--port` | UDP port to listen on | `514` |
| `--smtp-server` | SMTP server hostname | Required |
| `--smtp-port` | SMTP server port | `587` |
| `--sender-email` | Email address to send from | Required |
| `--recipient-email` | Email address(es) to send notifications to | Required |
| `--cc` | Optional email address(es) to CC on notifications | None |
| `--no-tls` | Disable TLS for SMTP connection | TLS enabled by default |
| `--test` | Run in test mode with sample messages | Disabled by default |
| `--debug` | Enable debug logging | Info level by default |


**Note:** The --recipient-email and --cc options now support multiple email addresses, separated by commas.

Example:
```bash
--recipient-email alice@example.com,bob@example.com --cc bobs-mum@example.com,alices-father@example.com
```
Additionally, add your user password here:
```python
# Create message queue
    message_queue = queue.Queue()
    EMAIL_PASSWORD = "ENTERPASSWORDHERE"
    # Create email configuration
```

## Test Mode

The script includes a test mode that can be used to validate functionality without an active Velociraptor instance:

```bash
python velociraptor-syslog.py --test \
  --smtp-server smtp.example.com \
  --smtp-port 587 \
  --sender-email alerts@example.com \
  --sender-password "your-password" \
  --recipient-email security-team@example.com
```

This requires a file named `velociraptor-syslog-key-logs.txt` in the same directory with sample log messages.

## Event Notifications

The script sends tailored email notifications for each detected event type. Examples include:

- `User admin executed "whoami" command through "CMD Shell" on endpoint "C.1234abcd" on 2023-04-26T14:35:22+00:00`
- `User analyst Quarantined the following endpoint(s): C.5678efgh on 2023-04-26T15:12:03+00:00`
- `User admin Created a hunt "Windows.System.ProcessListing" (H.ABCD1234), with a title of "Daily Process Hunt" and a description of "Collection of all running processes" on "root" org on 2023-04-26T09:15:43+00:00`


## Security Considerations

- The script listens on UDP port 514 by default, which is a privileged port (below 1024)
- Running with root/administrator privileges may be required for binding to this port
- Consider network segmentation to prevent unauthorized access to the syslog port
- Email credentials are specified in the code, which is considered a security risk.

Note: The sender email password has been embedded directly in the source code for ease of testing and demonstration purposes. For production use, it is strongly recommended to implement a secure method for managing secretsâ€”such as using environment variables, encrypted configuration files, or a dedicated secrets manager.

## Why?

Creating Wazuh decoders was a pain in the behind area, so like any cyber head, I just built a program that does the job from scratch.

Hope it helps someone out there.
